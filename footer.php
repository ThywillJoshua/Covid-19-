      <p>Yes, you should be vaccinated regardless of whether you already had COVID-19 because:</p><br>

      <ul>
        <li>Research has not yet shown how long you are protected from getting COVID-19 again after you recover from COVID-19.</li> <br>
        <li>Vaccination helps protect you even if you’ve already had COVID-19.</li> 
      </ul><br>
      <p>If you were treated for COVID-19 with monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma, you should wait 90 days before getting a COVID-19 vaccine. Talk to your doctor if you are unsure what treatments you received or if you have more questions about getting a COVID-19 vaccine.</p>

         <li>if you are indoors in public and you are in an area of substantial or high transmission.</li> <br>

      <p>We don’t know how long protection lasts for those who are vaccinated. What we do know is that COVID-19 has caused very serious illness and death for a lot of people. If you get COVID-19, you also risk giving it to loved ones who may get very sick. Getting a COVID-19 vaccine is a safer choice. Experts are working to learn more about both natural immunity and vaccine-induced immunity. CDC will keep the public informed as new evidence becomes available.</p>

        <p>The number of doses needed depends on which vaccine you receive. To get the most protection:</p><br>
        <ul>
          <li>Two Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine doses should be given 3 weeks (21 days) apart.</li>
          <li>Two Moderna vaccine doses should be given 1 month (28 days) apart.</li>
          <li>Johnson & Johnsons Jansen COVID-19 vaccine requires only one dose.</li>
        </ul><br>
        <p>If you receive a vaccine that requires two doses, you should get your second shot as close to the recommended interval as possible. However, your second dose may be given up to 6 weeks (42 days) after the first dose, if necessary. You should not get the second dose earlier than the recommended interval.</p>

        <p>People with underlying medical conditions can receive a COVID-19 vaccine as long as they have not had an immediate or severe allergic reaction to a COVID-19 vaccine or to any of the ingredients in the vaccine. Learn more about vaccination considerations for people with underlying medical conditions. Vaccination is an important consideration for adults of any age with certain underlying medical conditions because they are at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19.</p>

        <p>No. People with COVID-19 who have symptoms should wait to be vaccinated until they have recovered from their illness and have met the criteria for discontinuing isolation; those without symptoms should also wait until they meet the criteria before getting vaccinated. This guidance also applies to people who get COVID-19 before getting their second dose of vaccine.</p>
