    <h4>Be prepared for your plans to change</h4>
        <br>
     <p>No travel is risk-free during COVID. Countries may further restrict travel or bring in new rules at short notice, for example due to a new COVID-19 variant. Check with your travel company or airline for any transport changes which may delay your journey home.
        <br> <br>
       If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.
        <br> <br>
       Plan ahead and make sure you:</p> 
       <ul>
           <li>can access money</li>
           <li>understand what your insurance will cover</li>
           <li>can make arrangements to extend your stay and be away for longer than planned</li>
       </ul>

    <h3>Safer Travel Tips for Families with Unvaccinated Children</h3> <br>
    <p>We recommend delaying travel until you are able to get fully vaccinated. If you are traveling with children who cannot get vaccinated at this time, follow recommendations for people who are not fully vaccinated and choose the safer travel options described below. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Wear a mask over your nose and mouth in public. Wearing a mask over your nose and mouth is required on planes, buses, trains, and other forms of public transportation traveling into, within, or out of the country and while indoors at transportation hubs such as airports and stations. Travelers are not required to wear a mask in outdoor areas of a conveyance (like on open deck areas of a ferry or the uncovered top deck of a bus).</li> <br>
        <li>Avoid crowds and stay at least 6 feet/2 meters (about 2 arm lengths) from anyone who is not traveling with you.</li><br>
        <li>Wash hands often or use hand sanitizer (with at least 60%) alcohol.</li>
    </ul>
